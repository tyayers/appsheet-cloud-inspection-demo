# AppSheet Cloud Inspection Demo

This demo shows how a no-code AppSheet app can use a serverless API deployed in Google Cloud to leverage Gen AI and storage features to enhance a visual inspection scenario.

## Architecture

Here is a high level architecture diagram of the solution.

## Assets deployed

- Cloud Run containerized service written in Python to host the service and API
- A Firestore data collection used to persist the inspection data
- Vertex Gen AI Vision models to ask prompts about inspection photos

## Deploy

To deploy, simply click on this button to start a Google Cloud Shell tutorial to guide you through the deployment steps.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/tyayers/appsheet-cloud-inspection-demo&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=docs/tutorial.md)

Or you can also deploy manually by cloning this repo and running this script:

```bash
# First open the file 1_env.sh and change the variables to your project and region.

# Then set environment variables in your shell
source 1_env.sh

# Now configure your GCP project, service account, and run the deployment
./2_deploy.sh

# Insert a test data record into the Firestore DB so that AppSheet can detect the schema
./3_loaddata.sh

# Test the service by calling this curl command to get test data
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe $NAME --platform managed --region $REGION --format 'value(status.url)')
curl "$SERVICE_URL/images"
```

In case you get any errors running the above commands, or if the service doesn't appear to be deployed correctly, create an issue in this repo with the command outputs.
